If you need help, feel free to join this server and ask the question there:

Legit.

# How to install/use
Step 1: Download via this link: https://github.com/itssnee/discord-simple-token-checker/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
Step 2: Make sure you already downloaded python (https://www.python.org/).
Step 2 and a half: if you have a problem with the modules please run requirements.bat before starting the checker.py :]
Step 2(still lol): select your language (german = de, english = en, russian = ru), if you don't speak any of these languages properly, english is the best choice.
Step 3: Put your tokens into tokens.txt.
Step 4: double left click checker.py.
Step 5: enjoy.

# Why is there no source code?
since many ppl would sell it and I don't want people to just replace my discord name and tag with their discord name and tag.
if you think this is a virus you can check it with https://virustotal.com/
Source Code will maybe release in the future.
